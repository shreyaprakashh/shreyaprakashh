# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Shreya Prakash, a Computer Science & Engineering (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) undergraduate seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and continue developing technical expertise.

## About Me

I'm enthusiastic about leveraging data-driven insights and web technologies to create meaningful solutions. With a background in BTech CSE AIML and hands-on experience in both data science and web development, I enjoy exploring the intersection of these two domains to build innovative applications.

## ðŸ’» Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### Machine Learning Projects
- **Sign Language Recognizer**
  - This project translate Indian sign language alphabets into text using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system collects data in the form of images for each alphabet using OpenCV, preprocesses the images, trains an LSTM model, and then recognizes sign language gestures in real-time.

- **Stock Price Prediction**
  - This project develops an application for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Built with Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive interface where users can select a stock, view historical data, and generate future price predictions.
